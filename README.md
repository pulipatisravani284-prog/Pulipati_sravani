What is PWM?
Pulse Width Modulation is a technique of controlling the average voltage. It is a stream of voltage pulses that reduces the electric power supplied by the electrical signal. It is a square wave signal, which is represented as:

This implies that PWM has only 2 outputs i.e.,

HIGH (LOGIC 1).
LOW (LOGIC 0). The duty cycle of the rectangular pulse is shown as follows:

where,

to is the time period for which the signal is LOGIC 1.
tc is the total time period of the signal.
For example, let us assume that our output signal is having a timeperiod of 20ns,

0% Duty cycle implies that the signal is HIGH for 0ns and LOW for 20ns.
25% Duty cycle implies that the signal is HIGH for 5ns and LOW for 15ns.
50% Duty cycle implies that the signal is HIGH for 10ns and LOW for 10ns.
75% Duty cycle implies that the signal is HIGH for 15ns and LOW for 5ns.
100% Duty cycle implies that the signal is HIGH for 20ns and LOW for 0ns.

PWM Generator using Verilog-HDL
PWM generator was designed in Verilog-HDL using Xilinx Vivado 2022.2. There are few changes that has to be done in the Simulation time.

How to create a project in Xilinx Vivado 2022.2?
Step 1: Open Vivado 2022.2 on your system




<img width="292" height="405" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/086817c5-0ddf-4543-a081-a61a906df401" />


Step 2: Create a new project as follows: create project --> Next --> Project name: ____ --> Next --> check RTL Project --> Next --> click on Create File --> a dialog bx pops up prompting you to give the File name: ______ and click on Next --> Next.

Step 3: Select an FPGA board Category: General Purpose --> Family: Atrix-7 --> Package: csg324 --> Speed: -1 --> select xc7a100tcsg324-1 --> Next --> Finish.

Step 4: I/O Constraints (optional) can proceed even without giving the constraints just by clicking on Finish/Next as it can be defined in the module later.

How to change Simulation time?
As soon as you open your project click on settings icon provided in the tool bar as shown below.

This will pop up another Dialog box as shown below.

Follow the numbers (from 1 - 4)
The simulation time will be set to 1000ns by default. It can be changed according to our requirements.

Now copy paste the codes Variable_PWM.v and Variable_PWM_tb.v file one below the other and click on Run Simulation --> Run Behavioral Simulation to see the output waveform.
